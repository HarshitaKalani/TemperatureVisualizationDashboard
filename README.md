# TemperatureVisualizationDashboard
## Introduction
The TemperatureVisualizationDashboard is designed to offer an interactive exploration of temperatures across different regions in the world over time. The dataset used in this project contains historical temperature data, allowing for in-depth analysis and visualization of climate trends and variations, as well as displaying the evolution of the worldâ€™s temperature anomaly throughout the years. Through various plots and charts, the dashboard aims to provide insights into temperature patterns, extremes, and anomalies, aiding researchers, climate scientists, and enthusiasts in understanding the dynamics of global temperature changes.

## Data Overview
The TemperatureVisualizationDashboard dataset includes essential fields for temperature analysis, such as:
- Year:
  - Represents the year for which the temperature data is recorded.
  - Provides a temporal context for understanding temperature variations over time.
- Month:
  - Indicates the month corresponding to the temperature anomaly.
  - Helps in analyzing seasonal patterns and trends in temperature changes.
- Anomaly:
  - Refers to the temperature anomaly recorded for a specific month and year.
  - Represents the deviation of temperature from a reference value, providing insights into unusual temperature patterns.
- Temperature:
  - Represents the actual temperature recorded for a specific month and year.
  - Provides the base temperature data for calculating temperature anomalies.
- Statistics:
  - Includes statistical information related to temperature anomalies or other relevant metrics.
  - May include measures such as mean temperature, standard deviation, or other statistical summaries.
- Country:
  - Indicates the country or geographic region where the temperature data is collected.
  - Allows for geographic analysis and comparison of temperature patterns across different regions.
- ISO3:
  - Represents the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code for the country.
  - Provides a standardized code for each country, facilitating data integration and international comparisons.
 
  ## Data Analysis and Visualizations:
 We created different plots like scatter plot for anomaly trends, choropleth map for geographical analysis, histograms for temperature distributions, and other relevant plots.
